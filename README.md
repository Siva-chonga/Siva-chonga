<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sivaramakrishna Satya Manikantha</h1>
<h3 align="center">Hi, I am Sivaramakrishna Satya Manikantha,I have completed a Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Godavari Institute of Engineering and Technology (GIET). I have expertise in Manual and Automation Testing. I interned at Cognizant as a QA Engineer for six months. During my internship, I was responsible for both manual and automated testing of a banking application. I developed test cases, executed tests, and logged defects using tools like JIRA and Selenium. One of my proudest moments was developing an automation framework that streamlined the testing process and improved test coverage. This experience taught me the value of attention to detail, through documentation, and continuous learning. It provided me with a strong foundation in both manual and automation testing, preparing me for more complex testing roles in the future.</h3>
